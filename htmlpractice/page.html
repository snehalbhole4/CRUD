Here is the Sunerise	
</h1>
<p>
I started the album after realizing that I have a pretty cool collection of colorful skies from the morning and evening at different times during the year showing magnificent, at times unreal color, and majesty. Each day slightly different from the next, no two exactly the same.

What I also like about watching and capturing these colorful moments is that you really can’t look away, you have to pay attention. In just seconds the sky will change into something new and exciting. Knowing that you want to be present and in the moment and notice it all.
